# My dotfiles

This repository is a compilation of all my config files for linux-related uses. 
Useful because I tend to wanna install Linux on everything I touch.

## Installing

This is intended to be used as a git bare repository. If you don't know what
that is or want a refresher, 
see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBoLDpTWVOM).

After cloning the repository (and fixing potential file conflicts, specially
with .bashrc and .gitconfig), feel free to use the [install_config_dependencies](dev/.scripts/install_config_dependencies.sh)
script if there's anything broken.
